        <p>Hey everyone,</p>

        <p>I know you've all been waiting for the next update and I wanted to address the delays directly. First off, I want to thank everyone for their patience and continued support of TSB. This community is what makes this game what it is.</p>

        <p>The delays have been frustrating for everyone, including the dev team. We've been working around the clock to make sure the next update isn't just another patch - we're building something that's going to blow your minds. I'm not going to make excuses, but I want you to know that we're not sitting idle.</p>

        <p>Development has taken longer than we anticipated because we're not cutting corners. Every mechanic, every animation, every balance change is being tested and refined to meet the standards you deserve. We could rush it out, but that's not how we do things here.</p>

        <p class="greentext">&gt;tfw when the update is taking forever<br>
          &gt;but it's actually going to be worth the wait</p>

        <p>The next update is coming soon. We're in final testing now and ironing out the last bugs. I can't give you an exact date yet, but it's closer than you think. When it drops, you'll understand why we took our time.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sticking with us. Your passion keeps us going.</p>
